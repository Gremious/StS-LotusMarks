# StS-LotusCardsMod
A mod for Slay the Spire which adds a new "Lotus Mark" archetype for The Silent.
Has full Archetype-API support!

A synergy focused archetype in which some cards Mark target enemies and others increase their damage/effects based on how many marks there are.

A total of 8 cards, 4 attacks and 4 skills.

Card Example:

If you have any issues with the code/balance/bugs etc. feel free to add an issue.
Also if you can help me figure out how to make it so ModTheSpire doesn't complain about my mod wanting a lower base-game version I'd appreciate it.

Thank you and enjoy :)
